PROBLEM STATEMENT

Datastore Inc., a nationwide retail company operating in the United States, has experienced fluctuating profits over the last fiscal year. The company operates across multiple states across the country and offers a diverse range of products. Despite solid sales in certain regions, losses in others have raised concerns among executives. To address these issues, Datastore Inc. seeks to identify under-performing areas and implement strategies to improve profitability.

TASK
In this scenario, I am a data analyst at Datastore Inc. and my goal is to conduct a thorough analysis of the company's data, identify weak areas, and propose actionable recommendations.
    LINKS and RESOURCES related to the Project 

The analysis reveals significant profit gaps across regions, customer segments, and product categories. The Central region and 10 states, including Texas and Ohio, reported the lowest profits, with 22.8% of cities being loss-making. Targeted cost-reduction strategies, operational optimizations, and localized promotions are recommended to address these issues. The Consumer segment is the most profitable, while the Home Office and Corporate segments show growth potential, necessitating focused marketing and pricing strategies. Furniture profits lag behind other categories, requiring revised pricing, targeted campaigns, and supply chain optimizations to improve margins. These measures aim to enhance overall profitability and operational efficiency.

Understanding the Dataset

I will begin with trying to understand the structure of the dataset. There are 13 columns.

    6 of these columns contain Geographical data

    3 columns contain Product information

    4 columns contains Sales and Profit Information

    The remaining 1 column provides information on shipping mode

Observations, Analysis and Recommendations

I will begin with the Geographical Analysis
1. Geographical Analysis

Regions with lowest profits

Observations

    Central region has the lowest profits

    Western region, which is the highest profit making region, made nearly 2.5 times more profit than Central region.

Recommendations

    Analyze the operations in the states in the Central and South region to identify cost inefficiencies. Implement strategies to reduce expenses, such as renegotiating supplier contracts, optimizing logistics, or streamlining workforce allocation.

Worst Performing States

        Consumer Segment made the highest profit

        Room for growth in the Home Office Segment

    Recommendations

        Focus on Home Office Segment: Implement targeted marketing strategies and promotions for the Home Office segment to boost sales. Analyze product preferences within this segment to align offerings more closely with customer needs.

        Enhance Corporate Segment Profitability: Review operational costs and pricing strategies for the Corporate segment. Identify potential inefficiencies or opportunities to upsell high-margin products to corporate clients.

Total Profit by Product Category

    Observations

        Furniture profits are lagging far behind the other 2 categories.

    Recommendations

        Revise Furniture Pricing and Marketing Strategies: Analyze the pricing, discounts, and customer preferences for furniture products. Introduce competitive pricing, bundled offers, or targeted marketing campaigns to increase sales volume and improve profitability in this category.

        Streamline Furniture Costs: Evaluate the supply chain and operational costs related to furniture. Negotiate better supplier contracts or optimize shipping logistics to reduce expenses and increase profit margins.

Total Profit by Product Sub-Category

    Observations

        It was already observed in the previous step that that “Furniture” category was making far less profits compared to the other 2 segments. Here we observe that 2 of the 4 sub-categories (Tables and Bookcases) within the “Furniture” Category is loss- making.

        Also, “Supplies” sub-category within “Office Supplies” Category is loss making.

    Recommendations

        Recommendations are the same as the ones for “Furniture” category, but specifically tailored to Tables and Bookcases.

        Revise Tables and Bookcases Pricing and Marketing Strategies: Analyze the pricing, discounts, and customer preferences for . Introduce competitive pricing, bundled offers, or targeted marketing campaigns to increase sales volume and improve profitability in this category.

        Streamline Tables and Bookcases Costs: Evaluate the supply chain and operational costs related to Tables and Bookcases and negotiate better supplier contracts or optimize shipping logistics to reduce expenses and increase profit margins.
